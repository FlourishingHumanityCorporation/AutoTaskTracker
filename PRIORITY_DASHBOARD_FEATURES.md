## 🎪 Current Best Matches in Your Codebase

Based on your priorities, these existing dashboards are closest to what you want:

1. **`achievement_board.py`** - Best for daily reflection and accomplishment view
2. **`task_board.py`** - Best for interactive task exploration with AI features
3. **`task_board_enhanced.py`** - Best for visual appeal and engaging layout

**Recommendation:** Start with `task_board.py` as your base since it has the AI integration and filtering you need, then incorporate the visual design from `achievement_board.py` for the engaging presentation you want.
