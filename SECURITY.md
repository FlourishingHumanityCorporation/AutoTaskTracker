# Security Policy

## 🛡️ AutoTaskTracker Security

AutoTaskTracker implements comprehensive security measures specifically designed to address vulnerabilities in AI-generated code while maintaining developer productivity.

## 🎯 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in AutoTaskTracker, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: security@autotasktracker.dev
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond within 48 hours and provide a fix within 7 days for critical issues.

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Multi-Layered Defense

AutoTaskTracker uses a defense-in-depth approach:

1. **Static Analysis (SAST)**
   - Semgrep with AI-specific rules
   - Bandit for Python security
   - Custom rules for architectural patterns

2. **Supply Chain Security (SCA)**
   - Package legitimacy validation
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Slopsquatting protection

3. **Dynamic Testing (DAST)**
   - Dashboard security testing
   - Runtime vulnerability detection

4. **Human Review Process**
   - AI code review guidelines
   - Security-aware development practices

### Quick Security Check

```bash
# Run comprehensive security validation
make security-check

# Check specific components
make scan-code    # Static analysis
make scan-deps    # Dependency validation
make scan-dashboards  # Runtime testing
```

## 📋 Security Requirements

### For Contributors

All code contributions must:
- Pass security scans (`make security-check`)
- Use DatabaseManager for database access
- Include proper error handling
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow secure coding practices

### For Dependencies

New dependencies must:
- Pass package legitimacy validation
- Have no critical vulnerabilities
- Be actively maintained
- Have clear licensing
