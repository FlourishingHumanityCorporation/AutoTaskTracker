"""Mission-critical end-to-end checks for Pensieve backend.

These are deeper than the basic smoke tests:
1. Verify that running `memos record` actually inserts a row into the SQLite
   database.
2. Verify that within a short grace period, `processed_at` on that row becomes
   non-NULL (indicating the watcher/AI pipeline processed it).

All tests are tolerant of headless / CI environments and will xfail when the
scenario is impossible (e.g. screen capture blocked) rather than fail hard.
