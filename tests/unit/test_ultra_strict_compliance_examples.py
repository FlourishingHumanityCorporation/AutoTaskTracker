Ultra-strict compliance test examples.

This file demonstrates the highest quality testing standards for AutoTaskTracker:
- â‰¥5 meaningful assertions per test
- Complete state change validation
- Comprehensive error condition testing
- Performance benchmarks with specific targets
- Business rule validation
- Boundary condition testing
- Integration validation
- Real bug detection capability

These tests serve as examples for achieving 100% strict mode compliance.
