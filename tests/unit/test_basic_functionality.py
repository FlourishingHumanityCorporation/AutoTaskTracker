"""Goal-serving smoke tests for the AutoTaskTracker/Pensieve stack.

Run with:
    ./venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # one-time setup
    ./venv/bin/pytest -q                                    # each time you want to smoke-test

These tests assume:
1. You have already run `memos enable` and `memos start` (or will start them in another terminal) **OR**
2. You will run them manually and then rerun the failing test(s).

If the API service is not running, the `test_api_health` case will be skipped rather than fail.
