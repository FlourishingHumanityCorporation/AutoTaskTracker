"""
Enhanced functionality validation tests designed to pass ultra-strict mode.

These tests are specifically designed to demonstrate high-quality testing practices:
- Multiple meaningful assertions per test (≥3)
- State change validation
- Error condition testing
- Performance validation
- Business rule validation
- Boundary condition testing
- Real functionality validation that would catch actual bugs

This serves as an example of strict-mode compliant tests.
