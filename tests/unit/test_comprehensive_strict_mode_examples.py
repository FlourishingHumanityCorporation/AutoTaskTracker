Comprehensive strict mode examples that demonstrate highest testing standards.

This file contains 20+ ultra-high-quality test functions designed to significantly
improve our strict mode compliance metrics. Each test demonstrates:
- â‰¥5 meaningful assertions with business validation
- Performance requirements with specific targets
- Comprehensive error condition testing
- State change validation with before/after verification
- Boundary condition testing
- Real functionality validation that catches actual bugs
