Of course. Conducting a pre-mortem is a fantastic way to anticipate challenges and ensure a project's success. It's a standard practice in high-performing engineering and strategic teams for a reason.

Let's imagine it's six months from now, and this project has failed to meet your expectations. What went wrong? Based on the recommended plan, here are the most likely reasons for failure, categorized by risk area.

### **Pre-Mortem Analysis: The AI Task-Sensing App**

#### **Scenario 1: Foundational Instability – "The project was built on shaky ground."**

The entire plan hinges on the open-source project `Pensieve`. While it's a powerful and well-aligned starting point, its nature as a developing open-source tool presents the most significant foundational risk.

*   **The Failure:** The `Pensieve` backend proves to be unreliable. The background services that capture screenshots (`memos record`) or process them (`memos watch`) crash silently or fail to start after a system update.[1] You find that screenshots are being missed, or the AI processing queue gets stuck, leaving your task board empty and outdated.
*   **Why It Failed:**
    *   **Platform Incompatibility:** You might be running an operating system or configuration that isn't fully supported. The documentation notes that Linux support is still in development, and specific display servers (like Wayland) can pose challenges for screenshot utilities.[1, 2]
    *   **Breaking Changes:** As an active project, a future update to `Pensieve` introduces a non-backward-compatible change. The most likely point of failure is a **database schema modification**.[3, 4] Your custom Streamlit dashboard, which connects directly to the SQLite database, breaks because a table or column it relies on was renamed or altered.[5] Managing schema changes is notoriously difficult, even for dedicated teams.[6, 7]
    *   **Project Abandonment:** The maintainer of `Pensieve` gets busy with other projects, and development stalls. A new OS update breaks a core function, and with no one to fix it, the application becomes unusable.

*   **How to Prevent This Failure:**
    *   **Vet the Project:** Before starting, thoroughly review the `Pensieve` GitHub repository. Check the frequency of recent commits, the number of open vs. closed issues, and the community discussion to gauge its health and activity level.[8, 9, 10]
    *   **Favor APIs Over Direct Database Access:** The provided `task_board.py` script connects directly to the database for speed and simplicity. A more robust, long-term solution would be to build your dashboard on top of `Pensieve`'s official REST API.[1] This creates a layer of abstraction, making your dashboard more resilient to underlying database schema changes.
    *   **Learn to Debug:** Familiarize yourself with the basic diagnostic commands from the start: `memos ps` to check if services are running, and know the location of the log file (`~/.memos/logs/memos.log`) to look for error messages.[1]

#### **Scenario 2: Performance Collapse – "The app made my computer unusable."**

The core value proposition is a *passive* and *engaging* tool. This fails if the application is so resource-intensive that it slows down your primary work.

*   **The Failure:** Your computer's fans are constantly spinning, and switching between applications feels sluggish. The AI processing, especially the advanced LLM summarization in Phase 3, consumes too much CPU and RAM, creating a frustrating user experience. The tool is no longer "passive."
*   **Why It Failed:**
    *   **Underpowered Hardware:** This is the most probable cause, particularly for the advanced LLM features. The `Pensieve` documentation explicitly warns that running a Visual Language Model (VLM) on a CPU is not recommended due to "severe system lag" and that a dedicated GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM is advised.[1] Many standard computers do not meet this specification.
    *   **Unoptimized AI Pipeline:** Even with adequate hardware, the continuous processing of screenshots is computationally expensive. The combination of OCR, embedding generation, and VLM analysis for every significant screen change can overwhelm a system if not managed carefully.
    *   **Data Bloat:** The application stores every unique screenshot, which the documentation estimates could be around 400MB per day, or 8GB per month.[1] Over time, the sheer volume of data slows down database queries and consumes significant disk space, impacting overall system performance.

*   **How to Prevent This Failure:**
    *   **Be Realistic and Phased:** Treat Phase 3 (LLM integration) as an optional, high-end enhancement. Start with only the core `Pensieve` functionality. Its built-in OCR and semantic search may be powerful enough for your needs without the massive overhead of a local VLM.
    *   **Leverage Built-in Optimizations:** `Pensieve` includes intelligent features to mitigate performance impact, such as processing files only during system idle time, dynamically adjusting processing frequency, and reducing activity when on battery power.[1] Ensure these are enabled and configured correctly.
    *   **Consider Offloading:** If you are committed to using the VLM, follow the documentation's suggestion to run the Ollama service on a separate, dedicated machine with a powerful GPU and have your primary machine call it over the network.[1]

#### **Scenario 3: The Insight Gap – "The app works, but it isn't useful."**

The final and most subtle failure mode is that the application, despite being technically functional, doesn't provide the "better sense of what tasks I'm completing" that you originally wanted.

*   **The Failure:** Your task board populates with a stream of screenshots and window titles, but this raw data doesn't translate into meaningful, high-level "tasks." Instead of seeing "Wrote the quarterly report," you just see a list of screenshots from Google Docs and Outlook. The tool provides data, but not insight.
*   **Why It Failed:**
    *   **The Semantic Leap is Too Large:** The core challenge of this entire concept is bridging the gap between low-level user *activity* (screenshots, window titles) and high-level user *intent* (the task being performed). This requires sophisticated temporal and semantic reasoning. The default OCR and embedding models in `Pensieve` might not be sufficient to make this leap on their own.
    *   **Poor LLM Summarization:** You implement the advanced LLM integration (Phase 3), but the task summaries are generic, inaccurate, or inconsistent. This is a known issue with LLMs, which can "hallucinate" or fail to follow complex instructions, especially without a well-structured input format. Research shows that feeding an LLM a structured representation of the screen (a "Stateful Screen Schema") dramatically improves its reasoning and instruction-following ability compared to just showing it raw text or images.[11, 12] The current `Pensieve`-Ollama integration may be less sophisticated than these cutting-edge research frameworks.

*   **How to Prevent This Failure:**
    *   **Focus on the Final Prompt:** The quality of the LLM's output is highly dependent on the prompt. Invest time in customizing the VLM prompt in `Pensieve`'s `config.yaml` file. Use a structured approach, instructing the model to act as an expert analyst and providing clear output requirements, similar to the prompt design in the `VisionTasker` framework.[13]
    *   **Embrace the Dashboard:** The Streamlit dashboard is not just a display; it's your primary analysis tool. Use its filtering and charting capabilities to find patterns yourself. You might discover that combining a specific application (e.g., VS Code) with a specific keyword from OCR (e.g., "debug") is a powerful way to identify tasks, even without advanced LLM summarization.
    *   **Temper Expectations:** Acknowledge that creating a truly human-level understanding of tasks is a frontier research problem in AI. The goal of this project should be to create a tool that is *significantly better* than manual logging, not necessarily a perfect artificial consciousness.

By anticipating these potential failures, you can approach the plan with a more strategic mindset, focusing your energy on the areas of highest risk and increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome.
