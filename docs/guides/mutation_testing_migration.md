# Migration Guide: Legacy to Refactored Mutation Testing

This guide helps developers migrate from the legacy `SimpleMutationTester` to the new refactored mutation testing components.

## Overview

The mutation testing system has been refactored from a monolithic 854-line class into focused, maintainable components:

- **MutationGenerator** - Creates smart mutations
- **MutationExecutor** - Runs tests with mutations safely
- **MutationAnalyzer** - Analyzes results and provides recommendations
- **RefactoredMutationTester** - Composition layer orchestrating the components

## Migration Path

### Quick Migration (Recommended)

**Before:**
```python
from tests.health.testing import SimpleMutationTester

tester = SimpleMutationTester(project_root, config)
report = tester.analyze_test_effectiveness(test_file)
```

**After:**
```python
from tests.health.testing import RefactoredMutationTester

tester = RefactoredMutationTester(project_root, config)
report = tester.analyze_test_effectiveness(test_file)
```

The API is identical, so this is a drop-in replacement.

### Component-Level Migration (Advanced)

For fine-grained control, use the individual components:

```python
from tests.health.testing import MutationGenerator, MutationExecutor, MutationAnalyzer
from tests.health.testing.config import EffectivenessConfig

config = EffectivenessConfig()

# Initialize components
generator = MutationGenerator(max_mutations_per_file=config.mutation.max_mutations_per_file)
executor = MutationExecutor(project_root, config)
analyzer = MutationAnalyzer()

# Generate mutations
mutations = generator.generate_mutations(source_file)

# Execute mutations
results = []
for mutation in mutations:
    result = executor.execute_mutation(test_file, source_file, mutation)
    if result:
        results.append(result)

# Analyze results
report = analyzer.analyze_results(test_file, source_file, results)
```

## Performance Improvements

### Parallel Processing

The refactored system includes parallel processing capabilities:

```python
from tests.health.testing.parallel_analyzer import PerformanceManager

# Initialize with caching and parallel processing
manager = PerformanceManager(max_workers=4, cache_enabled=True)

# Analyze multiple files in parallel
files = [Path("test1.py"), Path("test2.py"), Path("test3.py")]
results = manager.analyze_files_parallel(
    analysis_func=tester.analyze_test_effectiveness,
    files=files
)

# Get performance statistics
stats = manager.get_performance_stats()
print(f"Cache hit rate: {stats['cache_hit_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Average analysis time: {stats['average_time']:.2f}s")
```

### Smart Caching

Enable smart caching for significant performance improvements:

```python
from tests.health.testing.parallel_analyzer import SmartCache

# Initialize cache
cache = SmartCache(max_size=1000, ttl_seconds=3600)

# Cache is automatically used by PerformanceManager
manager = PerformanceManager(cache=cache)
```

## Configuration Updates

### New Configuration Structure

The configuration system has been improved:

```python
from tests.health.testing.constants import (
    EffectivenessThresholds,
    CacheConfiguration, 
    PerformanceLimits,
    RetryConfiguration
)

# Access configuration values
thresholds = EffectivenessThresholds()
print(f"Good effectiveness threshold: {thresholds.GOOD}")

cache_config = CacheConfiguration()
print(f"Max cache entries: {cache_config.MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES}")

perf_limits = PerformanceLimits()
print(f"Git command timeout: {perf_limits.GIT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT}")
```

### Legacy Configuration Compatibility

Existing `EffectivenessConfig` objects still work:

```python
from tests.health.testing.config import EffectivenessConfig

config = EffectivenessConfig()
tester = RefactoredMutationTester(project_root, config)
```

## Error Handling Improvements

The refactored system includes better error handling:

### Specific Exception Types

**Before (Legacy):**
```python
try:
    result = tester.some_operation()
except Exception:  # Too broad!
    logger.error("Something went wrong")
```

**After (Refactored):**
```python
try:
    result = tester.some_operation()
except (OSError, UnicodeDecodeError, PermissionError) as e:
    logger.error(f"File operation failed: {e}")
except (ConnectionError, TimeoutError) as e:
    logger.error(f"Network operation failed: {e}")
```

### Retry Logic

The refactored system includes built-in retry logic for unreliable operations:

```python
from tests.health.testing.retry_utils import with_retry, GitOperations

# Automatic retries for Git operations
git_ops = GitOperations(project_root)
commits = git_ops.get_recent_commits(days=30)  # Includes retry logic
```

## Testing the Migration

### Verification Steps

1. **Run deprecation warning test:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_mutation_effectiveness.py::TestRefactoredMutationTester::test_deprecation_warning_on_legacy_use -v
```

2. **Test new components:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_mutation_refactoring.py -v
```

3. **Test performance components:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_parallel_analyzer.py -v
```

4. **Integration test:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/health/testing/test_effectiveness_validation.py::TestEffectivenessValidation::test_mutation_based_effectiveness -v
```

### Performance Comparison

Test the performance improvements:

```python
import time
from tests.health.testing import SimpleMutationTester, RefactoredMutationTester

# Time legacy system
start = time.time()
legacy_tester = SimpleMutationTester(project_root)  # Shows deprecation warning
legacy_report = legacy_tester.analyze_test_effectiveness(test_file)
legacy_time = time.time() - start

# Time refactored system
start = time.time()
new_tester = RefactoredMutationTester(project_root)
new_report = new_tester.analyze_test_effectiveness(test_file)
new_time = time.time() - start

print(f"Legacy: {legacy_time:.2f}s, Refactored: {new_time:.2f}s")
print(f"Speedup: {legacy_time/new_time:.1f}x")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Migration Issues

**1. Import Errors**
```python
# If you get import errors, ensure you're importing from the right module:
from tests.health.testing import RefactoredMutationTester  # ✅ Correct
from tests.health.testing.mutation_tester_refactored import RefactoredMutationTester  # ✅ Also correct
```

**2. Configuration Issues**
```python
# If config objects don't work, check the type:
from tests.health.testing.config import EffectivenessConfig
config = EffectivenessConfig()  # ✅ Correct type
```

**3. Performance Issues**
```python
# If performance is slower than expected, enable caching:
from tests.health.testing.parallel_analyzer import PerformanceManager
manager = PerformanceManager(cache_enabled=True, max_workers=4)
```

### Getting Help

- Check the test files in `tests/unit/test_mutation_refactoring.py` for usage examples
- Look at `tests/unit/test_parallel_analyzer.py` for performance feature examples
- Review `tests/health/testing/constants.py` for all configuration options

## Rollback Plan

If you need to temporarily revert to the legacy system:

1. The legacy `SimpleMutationTester` still works (with deprecation warnings)
2. All existing test files continue to function
3. No breaking changes have been introduced

However, the legacy system will be removed in a future version, so migration is recommended.
