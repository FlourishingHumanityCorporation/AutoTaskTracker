- [ ] No performance degradation (dashboard loads in <3 seconds)
- [ ] Database query performance maintained
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable

### User Experience Validation
- [ ] Users can quickly identify high-quality actionable tasks
- [ ] Task confidence and quality are immediately apparent
- [ ] Processing pipeline status provides useful feedback
- [ ] Export functionality includes enhanced task data
- [ ] Dashboard works gracefully when AI features are unavailable

## Rollback Plan

**If implementation fails:**
1. Revert commits: `git revert [commit-hash]`
2. Restore backup of `autotasktracker/dashboards/task_board.py`
3. Run health checks to confirm system stability: `pytest tests/health/ -v`
4. Verify basic dashboard functionality at http://localhost:8502

## Notes & Decisions

**Design decisions:**
- **Enhanced vs. New Dashboard**: Enhance existing task_board.py rather than create new dashboard to maintain user familiarity
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Leverage existing component system to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication
- **AI-First Approach**: Prioritize AI processing pipeline visibility to showcase AutoTaskTracker's core value proposition
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure dashboard remains functional even when AI features are unavailable

**Technical considerations:**
- **Database Performance**: New features should not significantly impact query performance
- **Pensieve Integration**: Maintain compatibility with existing Pensieve API patterns
- **Component Reusability**: New components should be reusable across other dashboards
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching for AI processing status and task confidence scores

**Blocked items:**
- [ ] None currently identified
